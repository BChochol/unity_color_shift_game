# Color Shift Game
## Simple 3D isometric puzzle game made as a personal project. Currently in development.
Right now uploaded as a raw Unity project folder.

Main mechanic of the game is being able to switch on and off different light colors inside each level. When a color light is on, corresponding objects of the same color disappear.
